# ERP System (Study Project)

This is a basic **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** system developed as a study project to understand the fundamental workflows involved in business resource management. The system is designed to handle **attendance**, **payments**, **invoices**, **ledgers**, and a **summary Profit & Loss (P&L)** report.

It is built using **Python** and intended to be run through a **web browser interface** for user-friendly interaction.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Web Interface** (via Streamlit or Flask – depending on implementation)
- **Multi-tab Input Sections**:
  - Attendance
  - Supplier/Buyer Payments
  - Invoices
- **Auto-generated Reports**:
  - Ledger per supplier or buyer
  - Profit & Loss Summary
  - Printable summary or individual ledgers
- **Data Persistence** using simple CSV/Excel (or can be extended to a database)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit / Flask (lightweight browser-based interface)
- **Backend**: Python
- **Data Storage**: Pandas (CSV/Excel-based for now)
